generic_agents.jl is for parsing a OSM map for its landuse zones and using those zones to randomly assign agents to destinations. It creates a list of generic and randomly generated agents ready to be used in the simulation.

mapper.jl and mapper.py are for creating the heatmaps after the simulation.

main.jl is the simulation with code/ and config.jl as helper files.
